\section{Query \& ground truth Construction}

\subsection{Synthetic query generation}
In this part, we will discuss how to split large tables and generate the corresponding ground truth.

+ How to choose large tables.

+ How to split.

+ How to generate the ground truth.

\subsection{Basic search for candidate generation}
In this part, for each synthetic or real query, we design a basic search algorithm to retrieve  candidate joinable/unionable tables from the data lake.


+ How to guarantee high recall

+ Details


\subsection{Human labeling}
In this part, we ask the human experts to label the candidates for each query. 

+ Example shown to the experts.


+ Labeling interface.


+ Labeling statistics.
